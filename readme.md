  - You must install SBT (simple build tool) to run scala project

 > echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
 > sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823
 > sudo apt-get update
 > sudo apt-get install sbt
 ```
